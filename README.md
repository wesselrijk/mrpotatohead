# MrPotatohead
A short description of the app MrPotatohead.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
The app is created in Android-Studio, it is currently made for API 24 Nougat (Android 7.0), but also confirmed running on API 28 Pie (Android 9.0).
An android phone with either one of those Android versions (and most likely the versions in between) will suffice.

### Testing
When starting the app, a screen appears showing an empty potato with numerous checkboxes below it.
